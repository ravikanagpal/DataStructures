     * A simple implementation uses two iterations. In the first iteration, we add each element's value as a key
     * and its index as a value to the hash table. Then, in the second iteration, we check
     * if each element's complement (targetâˆ’nums[i]) exists in the hash table. If it does exist,
     * we return current element's index and its complement's index. Beware that the complement must not be nums[i] itself!
     *
     * Time complexity: O(n). We traverse the list containing n elements exactly twice. Since the hash table reduces
     * the lookup time to O(1), the overall time complexity is O(n).
     *
     * Space complexity: O(n). The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table,
     * which stores exactly n elements.
